    "Title": "Hydration free energy of small molecules in water",
    "Description": "Model based on experimental and calculated hydration free energy of small molecules in water, the FreeSolv dataset from MoleculeNet. Hydration free energies are relevant to understand the binding interaction between a molecule (in solution) into its binding site.  This model has been trained using the GROVER transformer (see eos7w6n or grover-embedding for a detail of the molecular featurization step with GROVER). ",
